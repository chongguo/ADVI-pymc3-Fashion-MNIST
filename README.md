# ADVI in Pymc3
We test the performance of ADVI in Pymc3 using the Fashion-MINIST

to make the environment here use the following (assumes anaconda installation):
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

and if you're worried about system pollution, it can just as easily be removed with:
`conda env remove -n bbb_models`

To install additional components to the environment simply:
`conda activate bbb_models`

If using jupyter notebook or jupyter lab use the following to add the kernel to your options:
`conda install -n bbb_models nb_conda_kernels`
